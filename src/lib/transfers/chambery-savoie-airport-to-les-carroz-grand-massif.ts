Saturday is changeover day across the Alps and the busiest of the week on every mountain road — in February it can add an hour to this journey.

  faq: [
    { question: "How long is the transfer from Chambéry-Savoie Airport to Les Carroz?", reponse: "About 1 h 24 for 114 km on clear roads. Snow, chain controls and Saturday changeover traffic add to it — in high season a Saturday transfer can take an hour longer than the same drive midweek. Your driver plans for the day you travel." },
    { question: "How much does a transfer from Chambéry-Savoie to Les Carroz cost?", reponse: "The price depends on the vehicle category and the time of year, and it is quoted per vehicle rather than per seat — a group of six pays what a couple pays. Enter your journey to see your price before you book: tolls are included and nothing is added on arrival." },
    { question: "Which airport is closest to Les Carroz?", reponse: "Geneva, at 1 h 10 for 65 km. From Chambéry-Savoie it is 1 h 24. We serve Les Carroz from 2 airports in all, so the right one is usually decided by the flights available on your dates." },
    { question: "What happens if my flight is delayed?", reponse: "Nothing you need to do. We track your flight number and move the pick-up to your actual landing time. Your driver waits for you in the arrivals hall, and a delay does not change the price you were quoted." },
    { question: "Can you take our ski equipment?", reponse: "Yes, at no extra charge. Tell us how many bags and ski or board carriers you have when you book: in winter the boot fills up before the seats do, and the count is what decides the vehicle category we send." },
